Promobot
=============

Main board for Promobot, robotic platform. Still in development.

Schematic and layout done in Eagle.
Board has four VNH5019A-E H-bridge drivers for high current DC brushed motors, 50W 2ch audio amplifier (TPA116D2), two DC/DC step-up converters (TPS43061, up to 40V, 20A), one DC/DC step-down converter (TPS563200, 5V, 3A) and MCU for control (atmega32u4, Arduino Leonardo compatible).

It is initial design, so the board is big and bulky (15x15 cm). The board is manufactured and tested, but the current and power limits was not reached. There is a lot things to cut. Feel free to ask questions and make improvements.
